# DEX-TTS: Diffusion-based EXpressive Text-to-Speech with Style Modeling on Time Variability

This repository is the official implementation of DEX-TTS: Diffusion-based EXpressive Text-to-Speech with Style Modeling on Time Variability. 

In this repository, we provide steps for running DEX-TTS and GeDEX-TTS. 

You can find each repository in ```./DEX-TTS``` and ```./GeDEX-TTS```.

üôè We recommend you visit our [demo site](https://dextts.github.io/demo.github.io/). üôè

## Updates

For expressive TTS, we use the VCTK and ESD datasets.



## ToDo
- [X] Bigvgan vocoder for multi-speaker TTS
- [ ] Multi-gpu training codes
- [ ] LibriTTS & Simpe preprocess recipes
- [ ] Pre-trained weight
- [ ] Precondition VE & VP
- [ ] Evaluation
