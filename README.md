# DEX-TTS: Diffusion-based EXpressive Text-to-Speech with Style Modeling on Time Variability

This repository is the official implementation of DEX-TTS: Diffusion-based EXpressive Text-to-Speech with Style Modeling on Time Variability. 

In this repository, we provide steps for running DEX-TTS and GeDEX-TTS. 

You can find each repository in ```./DEX-TTS``` and ```./GeDEX-TTS```.

üôè We recommend you visit our [demo site](https://dextts.github.io/demo.github.io/). üôè

## Updates

For expressive TTS, we use the VCTK and ESD datasets.

- The VCTK dataset can be downloaded [here](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2651).


## TODO
- [ ] Update bigvgan vocoder 
- [ ] Update code for DEX-TTS
- [ ] Update code for GeDEX-TTS
- [ ] Multi-gpu training
- [ ] Preprocess simpler version
- [ ] Pre-trained weight
- [ ] Evaluation
