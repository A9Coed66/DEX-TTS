# DEX-TTS: Diffusion-based EXpressive Text-to-Speech with Style Modeling on Time Variability

This repository is the official implementation of DEX-TTS: Diffusion-based EXpressive Text-to-Speech with Style Modeling on Time Variability. 

In this repository, we provide steps for running DEX-TTS and GeDEX-TTS. 

You can find each repository in ```./DEX-TTS``` and ```./GeDEX-TTS```.
